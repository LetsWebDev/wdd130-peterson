        <h1>Skills</h1>
        <p>Game development isn’t just for programmers. Writing, storytelling, art, animation, 3D modeling, sound, and design all play a crucial role in bringing a game to life. Even the most impressive code can’t create a fun or meaningful experience on its own. Great games come from a healthy mix of creative and technical skills. You don't have to be a skilled programmer to make fun experiences for users to enjoy.</p>

        <h1>Why Game Developement</h1>
        <p>If you enjoy playing video games and have even a spark of creativity or technical knowledge, game development could be a great fit for you. Whether you’re interested in crafting stories, designing art, composing music and audio, or experimenting with code, this field has a place for a broad range of skills. It’s easy to start, whether as a personal hobby or a collaborative effort with friends or classmates. And even if you don’t pursue game development professionally, the skills you build while developing games can be translated directly into many other creative and technical industries.</p>

        <h1>Resources</h1>
        <p>Getting started with game development is completely free, assuming you already have a computer. There’s a large variety of open-source and free tools that give you everything you need to create games from scratch. Engines like Godot and Game Maker, art tools like Piskel and Krita, 3D software like Blender, and audio programs such as LMMS are all powerful and beginner friendly. Even simple tools such as notes apps for planning or GitHub for version control, can support your process.</p>

        <h1>My Projects</h1>
        <p>When I was in my 6th grade, I was introduced to a website called scratch, and without any prior experience I made my first game. Although it was simple and unimpressive, it introduced me to the field of game development. I was intrigued by how I could use my knowledge of mathematics and interest in art and creativity to make something that I enjoyed as a hobby and a potential career.</p>
