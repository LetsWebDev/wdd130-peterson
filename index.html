        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>Game development isn’t just for programmers. Writing, storytelling, art, animation, 3D modeling, sound, and design all play a crucial role in bringing a game to life. Even the most impressive code can’t create a fun or meaningful experience on its own. Great games come from a healthy mix of creative and technical skills. You don't have to be a skilled programmer to make fun experiences for users to enjoy.</p>

            <p>If you enjoy playing video games and have even a spark of creativity or technical knowledge, game development could be a great fit for you. Whether you’re interested in crafting stories, designing art, composing music and audio, or experimenting with code, this field has a place for a broad range of skills. It’s easy to start, whether as a personal hobby or a collaborative effort with friends or classmates. And even if you don’t pursue game development professionally, the skills you build while developing games can be translated directly into many other creative and technical industries.</p>
