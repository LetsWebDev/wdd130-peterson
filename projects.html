        <h1>My Projects</h1>
        <p>When I was in my 6th grade, I was introduced to a website called scratch, and without any prior experience I made my first game. Although it was simple and unimpressive, it introduced me to the field of game development. I was intrigued by how I could use my knowledge of mathematics and interest in art and creativity to make something that I enjoyed as a hobby and a potential career.</p>
